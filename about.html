                <img src="./images/person-1.jpg" alt="random person">
                <p>I have never met such a fantastic guy, who is helpful, speaks so many languages and will do anything
                    for his guests. You name it, he will do it.
                    Alex is so caring and nothing is too much trouble for him. He has got such a dry sense of humour
                    which is appealing. From Day 1 he will know your name, your partners name and all of the children's
                    names and he will never forget it while you are staying there.He runs the bar, makes the snacks,
                    cleans the pool from very early to very late. Whenever he went out he would always ask do you want
                    anything bringing back. Thanks for the water and ice-cream Alex!!!
                    The rooms vary in style and size. There is a fantastic new bungalow and two massive apartments which
                    are more like penthouses!
                    Our room was very clean with maid service everyday</p>
